                     Neobrutalism is an aesthetic characterized by high contrast
                     elements, bright colors, and bold shapes. It is often used to make
                     a statement, as it is meant to be eye-catching and stand out to
                     the viewer. It is also used in user interface and web design, with
                     features such as vibrant colors and bold shapes. Neobrutalism can
                     also be used in print design, with an example being a bold shape
                     with a vibrant color fill applied to it.
